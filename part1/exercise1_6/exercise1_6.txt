# First pull the image
> docker pull devopsdockeruh/overwrite_cmd_exercise

# Run the image to see what happens
> docker run devopsdockeruh/overwrite_cmd_exercise

-h,             --help                  to show this message
-a [age],       --adult [age]           to check if you're older than 18
-c [time],      --clock [time]          to start a clock
-t [size],      --triangle [size]       to draw a triangle, takes second argument as the size

# Then after trial and error realize that instead of overriding the CMD in the image
# one can just put CMD ["-c"] in the Dockerfile.
# Build the dockerfile:
> docker build -t

# After building we can run the image
> docker run docker-clock
