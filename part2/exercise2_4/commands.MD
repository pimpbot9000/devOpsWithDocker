## Exercise 2.4

### Step 1.
Clone the scaling-exercise repo. Note: I did not add the cloned stuff into this submission, I wanted to save space in the world.

### Step 2.
Since there's already a proper ```docker-compose.yml``` in the repo all is needed to scale it is by running it by scaling the ```compute```.

```> docker-compose up --scale compute=3```

### Step 3.

Open a browser and see if it works, and by golly, it does!
